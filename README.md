<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a frontend clone of [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), using the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)...

## Live version [here](https://amy-reddit.netlify.app/).
<br>

### Built With

* React
* CSS
* [Markedjs](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)
<br>

## Demo & Screenshots
Some videos in case there are any changes to the Reddit API that result in the live site not functioning correctly: <br>


## Next Steps
* Use the before/after API endpoints to alert users of new posts, and to load posts when the user scrolls towards the bottom of the page
* Add default trending posts/subreddits to the navbar that display automatically if there are no subreddits that match the current search, or while the searchbar is empty 
* Create the homepage for each user, pulling in their post data and comment history

## Current Issues
* The fetch requests for each page sometimes take a few seconds to load all the data, so all the data doesn't always display at the same time
<br>
