<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a frontend clone of [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), using the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) to display posts and comments as on reddit.com. This version allows searching by hot, new, top and rising (and sub-searching by top of today, this week, this month, this year and all time). This SPA has 3 'pages' - the homepage, a page for each subtopic (subreddit) and a page for each post. Click on any link beginning with "r/" to visit a subreddit homepage, and click on the content of any post, its title or comment button to visit the post in detail including all comments.

### Built With

* React
* CSS
* [Markedjs](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)
<br>

## Demo & Screenshots
Some videos in case there are any changes to the Reddit API that result in the live site not functioning correctly: <br>
<div align="center">
  <img src="./readme/homepage.gif" width="80%" />
  <br><br><br>
  <img src="./readme/top.gif" width="80%" />
  <br><br><br>
  <img src="./readme/subhome.gif" width="80%" />
</div>
<br><br>

## Next Steps
* Use the before/after API endpoints to alert users of new posts, and to load posts when the user scrolls towards the bottom of the page
* Add default trending posts/subreddits to the navbar that display automatically if there are no subreddits that match the current search, or while the searchbar is empty 
* Create the homepage for each user, pulling in their post data and comment history

## Current Issues
* The fetch requests for each page sometimes take a few seconds to load all the data, so all the data doesn't always display at the same time
* Due to CORS issues with the Reddit API, the site doesn't display correctly on Firefox, though works fine on Firefox Developer Edition.
